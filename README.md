Welcome to my capstone Movies Popularity Predictor and Recommendation System project repository! This analysis aims to help Spectrum expand beyond being just a cable company and venture into the online streaming business.

This analysis consists of four main parts: EDA, predictive regression modeling, recommendation system development using Hugging Face embedding and cosine similarity, and a deployment demo. Each part offers tools and insights to help Spectrum excel in the online streaming business.
